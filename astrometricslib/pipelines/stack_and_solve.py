"""Runs Siril stacking as a tracked job, with a hard timeout.

`stack_frames_with_timeout` is the only way stacking gets called in this
codebase: it registers the run as a job (so it shows up in the UI's job
tracker the same way analysis runs do), then runs Siril in the
background and abandons it if it takes too long, since the underlying
process can occasionally hang.
